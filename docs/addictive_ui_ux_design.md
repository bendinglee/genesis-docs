### 3. Social Connection & Recognition
Every action is visible to the community (with privacy controls), creating social accountability and recognition that drives continued participation.

### 4. Meaningful Contribution
Users understand how their actions contribute to the larger mission, creating intrinsic motivation beyond extrinsic rewards.

### 5. Beautiful & Intuitive
Stunning visual design with smooth animations and intuitive interactions that feel magical and effortless.
